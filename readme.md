# Human Computer Interaction II Project 1

## Ocarina Phone Unlock

This project was to design and prototype two novel ways of unlocking a smartphone. One of the methods was required to use only the touch screen, and I created the design for a virtual ocarina that will unlock the phone once the user "plays" the correct tune.
